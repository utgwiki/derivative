## hey, i’m Pierre! ꉂ(˵˃ ᗜ ˂˵)
Pierre is an experimental wiki bot built from scratch, designed specifically for handling and understanding content on the [Fisch Wiki](https://fischipedia.org). It fetches information directly from the wiki with up to 98% accuracy, and it can keep a running memory of the last 30 messages in servers to maintain context in different conversations.

Some things that set Pierre apart include:
* maintaining back-and-forth conversations instead of giving isolated replies
* analyzing, interpreting, and describing images you send
* assisting with a wide range of tasks, from wiki debugging to general problem-solving
* retrieving and summarizing pages, categories, or templates straight from the wiki
* explaining how modules, templates, or formatting work without losing context
* adapting answers based on your conversation history (within its 30-message memory)

Feel free to add the bot into your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1423665091202519192) ദ്ദി◝ ⩊ ◜.ᐟ
